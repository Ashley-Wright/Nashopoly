          <h2>How much money do I win for landing on Free Parking?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class='faq_content_answer'>
          <p>In the official rules, Free Parking is just that -- a place to hang out for a turn where nothing happens, good or bad.

But there's more to the story.  Darrow's design was strikingly similar to one patented on January 5, 1904, by Lizzie J. Magie, a Quaker woman from Virginia. He game was calledThe Landlord's Game and was based on the philosophy that the renting of land and real estate produced an unearned increase in land values that profited a few individuals (landlords) rather than the majority of the people (tenants).</p>
